## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project is purely educational. It allows me to train on modern technologies and using microservices rather than a monolithic project.

The Good corner allows a user to create and connect to an account in order to post ads for the sale of their personal items. The user can also purchase products from other people on the site.
There is also a back office available for administrators to monitor what is happening on the site.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

You have to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Run the `docker-compose.yml` at the root of project.

```
docker compose up --build
```

Now you can edit a file and see hot-reload for developpment.
